# arrow-match
* Pattern matcher at O(n) speed.
* Performing the match with push-down-automata.
* Configurable disambiguity policies, thus, support 'ealiest-match' or 'longest-match' or both at the same time, or any arbitrary disambiguity tweaks you want.
* Never backtrace, that's what an 'arrow' mean.
